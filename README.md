# Yomira

Yomira is a self-hosted platform for storing, organizing, and reading comics — including manga, manhwa, manhua, and webtoons.

At its core, Yomira gives you a personal library you fully own. Instead of relying on aggregator sites that may disappear overnight, serve intrusive ads, throttle reading speed, or restrict access to certain regions, Yomira lets you build and maintain your own archive entirely on your own terms. Your collection lives on your machine, under your control, and is accessible whenever you need it.

## How It Works

Content is collected through the **Yomira mobile app**. Users install source extensions — small, sandboxed plugins that connect to individual comic sites — and browse those sources directly within the app, just like using any regular reader app.

What sets Yomira apart is what happens in the background: as you read or download a chapter, Yomira quietly captures the page images and accompanying metadata, then syncs them to your personal Yomira installation. No manual steps, no exports, no extra tools.

Once a comic is in your library, it stays there. You can read it from your phone, through the web interface on your laptop, or hand the library off to someone else on the same network — all without depending on whether the original source is still online.

## Features

### Library Management
- Store comics with full metadata: title, alternative titles, authors, artists, genres, publication status, and synopsis.
- Organize your collection with custom tags and reading status labels (Reading, Completed, On Hold, Dropped, Plan to Read).
- Manually edit or correct metadata for any entry in your library.
- Track which chapters you have archived versus which are still pending.
- Browse your library through filters, sorting options, and full-text search.

### Reading Experience
- Clean, distraction-free reader available on both mobile and web.
- Supports multiple reading directions: left-to-right, right-to-left, and vertical scroll for webtoon-style content.
- Pages are preloaded intelligently so transitions feel instant, even on slower connections.
- The app remembers exactly where you stopped, per chapter and per device, and syncs your progress so you can continue seamlessly from any other device.
- Download chapters to your device for fully offline reading — no connection required once a chapter is saved.

### Source Extensions
- Extensions are independently installable plugins that connect Yomira to specific comic websites.
- Each extension is isolated: it runs in a restricted environment that limits what it can access, keeping your device and library safe.
- Extensions handle the differences between sites — page structures, image loading patterns, chapter ordering — so the rest of the app stays consistent regardless of the source.
- Multiple extensions can be active simultaneously, letting you browse several sources from a single interface without switching apps.
- When a source website changes its structure and breaks an extension, only that extension needs to be updated — the rest of your library and reading experience is unaffected.

### Sync & Backup
- Any content browsed or downloaded through the mobile app is automatically pushed to your Yomira installation.
- Reading progress, bookmarks, and library changes sync across all connected devices in real time.
- Your archive is entirely stored on infrastructure you control, making it straightforward to back up or migrate.

### Multi-User Support
- Multiple accounts can be created under a single Yomira installation — useful for households or small groups.
- Each user maintains their own reading history, bookmarks, and library status independently.
- All users share access to the same underlying comic archive, avoiding duplicate storage.
- Administrators can manage user accounts, control access permissions, and oversee the overall state of the library.

### Web Interface
- Access your full library from any browser without installing anything.
- The web reader supports the same reading modes and progress sync as the mobile app.
- The admin panel provides a comprehensive view of your library: storage usage, metadata gaps, archived versus missing chapters, and user activity.
- Metadata can be edited directly from the web interface, making large-scale library curation practical without needing a mobile device.
